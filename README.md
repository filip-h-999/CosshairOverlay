# Crosshair Overlay
Pygame Crosshair Overlay for Every Game

This is a simple Pygame-based crosshair overlay that can be used in any game running in windowed or borderless mode. The overlay is a transparent Pygame window that is always on top of other windows, making it possible to use it to aim in games that don't provide a crosshair.

How to use:

For making the pygamewindow transparent and show only the crosshair press "n"
For closing the window press "b"
